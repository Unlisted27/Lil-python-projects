Makex is a simple program which makes python files executable and places them in the /usr/bin directory.
Reccomended first use for makex is on itself, example: 
  sudo /bin/python3 /home/username/pythonproj/makex.py /home/username/pythonproj/general/makex.py
This will turn makex into executable and make it ready to run on other scripts.
After that, use makex from the console/terminal command line, example:
  sudo makex /home/pythonproj/test/helloworld.py
