Little project, prob needs some tweaking.
Was prob tweaking while making.
This program should allow you to make "Scrolling" or "Falling" ascii art.
By that I mean art drawn line by line, possibly at an interval if you want to make a fancy revealing logo, as demonstrated in the opening sequence of my lockness OS project.
